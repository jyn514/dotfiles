# dotfiles
Personal dotfiles. You know how hard it is to keep track of those things? Not to mention all the package maintainers trying to change them constantly. Real nightmare, I tell 'ya.

You know, when I made this repo, I was really tempted to use the [Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/).
The only reason I didn't is Github doesn't have an automated template for that.
How's that for laziness?

Why are you reading this?

This is a dotfile repo. It holds dotfiles. 

If you like my dotfiles, you can have them. I mostly copied other people anyway.
